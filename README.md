```bash
# Start a session with default profile
velo-tracker start

# Start a session with a specific AWS profile
velo-tracker start --profile my-profile

# Start a session with a specific Amazon Q profile
velo-tracker start --q-profile my-q-profile

## üîÑ Shell Integration

Velo Tracker integrates with your shell to automatically track Amazon Q Dev CLI sessions. When you run `q chat`, the shell hook:

1. Detects the AWS profile being used (from command line arguments or environment variables)
2. Detects the Amazon Q profile being used (from command line arguments)
3. Starts a logging session with `velo-tracker start`
4. Runs the original `q chat` command
5. Ends the logging session with `velo-tracker end` when you exit Amazon Q

This provides seamless tracking without requiring manual intervention.

## üß© Amazon Q Profiles

Amazon Q supports custom profiles that can be created using the `/profile` command within a chat session. Velo Tracker can track which Amazon Q profile was used for each session, allowing you to:

- Track usage across different Amazon Q profiles
- Compare productivity between different profile configurations
- Understand which profiles you use most frequently

To use this feature:

1. Create Amazon Q profiles using the `/profile` command in Amazon Q
2. Start Amazon Q with a specific profile: `q chat --profile my-q-profile`
3. The shell integration will automatically detect and log the Amazon Q profile
4. View profile-specific usage with `velo-tracker list --q-profile my-q-profile`

## üìä Feature Tracking

Velo Tracker includes a built-in feature tracking system to manage development and track progress:

```bash
# Add a new feature to track
velo-tracker feature add -n "Feature name" -d "Detailed description" -p high

# List all tracked features
velo-tracker feature list

# Update feature status
velo-tracker feature update -i <feature-id> -s in-progress

# Add progress updates
velo-tracker feature progress -i <feature-id> -m "Implemented core functionality" -p 50

# View progress for a specific feature
velo-tracker feature show-progress -i <feature-id>

# Create GitHub issues for features (maintainers only)
velo-tracker feature add -n "Feature name" -d "Description" --github --github-token <token>
```

This feature tracking system helps maintain transparency in development and provides a clear roadmap for future enhancements.

## üîå AI Chatbot Integration

Velo Tracker can be integrated with AI chatbots like Amazon Q, Cursor AI, and others through its Model Context Protocol (MCP) server:

```bash
# Start the MCP server
velo-tracker server

# Start the server on a specific port
velo-tracker server --port 3000
```

### Integration Examples

The package includes example integrations for popular AI chatbots:

- **Amazon Q**: Track sessions and feature development in Amazon Q
- **Cursor AI**: Monitor coding sessions and feature progress in Cursor AI

### API Endpoints

The MCP server provides RESTful API endpoints for:

- Session management (start/end/list)
- Feature tracking (create/update/list)
- Progress monitoring (add/view progress updates)

### Client Library

Use the built-in client library to integrate with the MCP server:

```javascript
const { MCPClient } = require('velo-tracker');

// Create a client
const client = new MCPClient('localhost', 3000);

// Start a session
const session = await client.startSession('my-project', 'my-ai-profile');

// Create a feature
const feature = await client.createFeature('New Feature', 'Description', 'high');

// Update progress
await client.addProgress(feature.id, 'Implemented core functionality', 50);
```

## üìÅ Log Structure

Logs are stored in a structured format in the following directory:

```
~/.velo-tracker/logs/<profile>/
```

Each profile directory contains:
- `combined.log`: All log entries
- `error.log`: Error log entries only
- `active-session.json`: Currently active session (if any)
- `archive/`: Directory containing completed session information

Session data is stored as JSON files, making it easy to integrate with other tools or perform custom analysis.
